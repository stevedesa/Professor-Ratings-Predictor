review
"Expect to teach yourself if you take any of his classes, the lectures are rough and the workload is a lot for what the class is. Expect to have random and unnecessary points taken from exams and you will have to go and argue for them back. This class just made learning more painful than it needed to be. Too bad he's the only option for the class."
Professor is quite difficult to follow in lecture. Labs are unreasonably difficult at times with content that was not adequately discussed prior to the lab. I constantly felt like I was battling to teach everything to myself. Professor is also quite unhelpful when answering questions. Generally just avoid taking him if you can. Exams are tough
"Overall just a poor professor. Pop quizzes on things you learned that day in lecture, exams are rough, lectures don't make a lot of sense and contradict the book yet when asked about it he says to refer to both, zero accountability on poor teaching."
"Lots of coursework, confusing slides, and inadequate explanations in class. Be prepared to learn everything by yourself. Your TA would be your best resource. The labs would become exponentially harder every time. The homeworks will be linked with each other. The class would start off very rough but ease at the end."
"Not good at engaging the class and explaining the course materials in lecture. The lectures failed to cover many key concepts (such as using `gdb` for debugging purposes) which left us underprepared for the exams, projects, and labs. The individual project was tested in an inconsistent, opaque fashion that caused many students to get low scores."
"Whatever you do, avoid this class. Random pop quizzes that take the entire hour for everybody, semester projects that don't relate to what we are being taught, slides are from a different professor, no textbook, extremely harsh grading, grading criteria's with at least 5 different ways to fail the class, advanced math topics not listed in pre-reqs."
"One of the most reasonable professors at this school in every class I've had with him. My recommendation would be to take as many classes with him as you can. He makes sure to cover everything in lectures so you never really need the textbook and is a fairly nice grader. As far as CS professors go, you can't get much better."
"Second class I've had with this professor and taking another next semester. Both classes were a little bit difficult but manageable. Professor is nice, works with students, gives interesting labs to help get certain ideas and points across. Definitely one of the best CSC professors to take."
"Professor Belcher is easily one of my favorite professors on campus. His lectures were very informative and organized, and his grading criteria was always unambiguous. If you have a real desire to learn how to program and code, this is the teacher to learn from."
"Fun professor with fun activities and monty python clips. Pretty standard intro to python course, very beginner friendly."
One of my favorite professors on campus. He cares a lot for his students' success and puts a lot of effort into making the class fun and interesting.
"Dr. Belcher is an great professor and really knows his stuff when it comes to coding. His lectures allow students to follow along and coding with him, which is great for an introductory coding class. The labs he assigns are fun, and he allows retakes on quizzes. He is also a huge Monty Python fan and will show several clips throughout the semester."
"Fantastic professor. He factors in everyone's input and is very friendly to people in and outside of class. If you make a mistake on something, he will always let you redo it for a higher grade. This is the case except for the exams."
Professor Belcher is an overall great professor. At the beginning of the semester I told him that I was nervous about learning to code and he checked in on me several times. He made Python incredibly approachable and I felt like he was available for any questions I had at multiple times during the semester.
Attendance is mandatory but he makes class so much fun. His lectures are always helpful and easy to understand. I go to office hours and he's always so nice and really helpful. The tests seem hard at first but he really does try to give you points wherever he can. You can tell he really wants everyone to succeed. 10/10 Super cool professor!
"Do not take CSC170 with anyone else. Prof. Belcher is one of the most kind and caring professors I have ever had, and made csc go from death to your degree to a task you can easily conquer. He will help you on exams, labs, programs, and readily sets you up to succeed."
"Be as engaged in class as possible. Belcher gives many opportunities to make up lost points on exams. He is very easy to reach outside of class. He takes his time and gets to know us, not only as students, but as people too. He was able to understand that not many of us knew how to code and he took his time to teach us. 10/10 would recommend again!"
"Will teach you if you're willing to learn. I noticed that a lot of students didn't pay much attention, and thus their understanding suffered. Don't let that be you."
"Professor Belcher cares about advancing the students' basic knowledge of CSC and understands that this class should not tank students' GPAs. He made himself very accessible for students needing extra help understanding material, and he offered opportunities for extra credit to help make up lost points. Overall, I highly recommend him for CSC170."
Expect the worst instructions and pseudo code possible for your projects. They will take an excessive amount of time. Also has some of the worst quizzes I've ever had. If she wasn't the only professor that teaches 372 and 461 I would tell you to take it with anyone else. Good luck
"really is not that difficult of a class. Several attempts at online quizzes, note card for the exams, projects are not that difficult if you pay attention or look at slides. You even get an option second chance exam if you failed an exam/project. Her slides and textbook has a lot of good and helpful stuff"
"Dr. R is a good lecturer, but her assignments are difficult and mostly unclear as to what specifically she is looking for. Projects are crammed into the schedule on top of take home quizzes and tests. I would not take this class unless it is required, and beware if your other classes exceed 12 credits. You will not have time."
"Dr. Rebenitsch is such a nice person, it makes me sad to leave a negative review. I've had her for 3 classes. While I've done well in all 3, they have all have been somewhat miserable because of her assignments. They are disorganized, long, and menial, and poor project choice. Will probably be the worst thing I remember about college."
"Fine teacher. Tests aren't too bad but she never proof reads her tests or assignments so it is VERY hard to understand what she is meaning. Projects are absolutely brutal, hardest you will come across. Multiple all nighters working on it, so make sure you really get a head start on them. Would be much easier if her instructions were better."
Lectures have good class interaction. Tests are not difficult. Grading is reasonable and scary fast at times. Gives chances for EC. Very helpful and friendly outside of class. Posts slides and practice exams online. My biggest complaint is her seeming unwillingness to proofread. I often spent half the assignment trying to decipher what she wanted.
"She is an awful lecturer. She obviously knows what she is talking about, but does a poor job of explaining it - coming from someone who understands what she is teaching. The book is a godsend if you want a scientific, logical, and/or mathematical approach to what she says. She gives lots of work, but do it when it's assigned and you'll be fine."
"Dr. Rebenitsch is a great professor! I've had her for three classes and have enjoyed them all. Everything in the class is clearly planned before the semester begins. She is very clear what she expects on homework and exams. She gives lots of projects, and they are all relevant to the material she teaches."
"The professor tells you exactly what she expects, has interactive lectures, and actually cares about your learning all while sharing realivent workforce situations and experiences."
Havent finished the semester yet so opinion might change but she is super enthusiastic about the subject and approachable if you ever have a problem you can approach her or a teachers aide. She does rush through topics from time to time but she is always willing to answer questions both in and out of class and in general. Fun if you like to code.
"Rebenitsch is a good professor. She does mess up a few times during lectures but does her best to explain concepts well. She expects a lot out of her students so her class isn't an easy A. Also, I gotta say, she has surprisingly good taste in fashion."
"Taught coding class by writing lines of code on a chalkboard... not advisable even if you have the neatest handwriting and are super organized about it - which, of course, she was not. It was very easy to get lost in her class."
"I loved Professor Rebenitsch. She is kind of awkward, but I found her quite charming. Her class wasn't too hard if you're into programming."
She was completely lost. Stumbled over herself throughout the class. In her own world: takes longer to figure out what she wants than it does to actually do the assignment. She undoubtedly cares but is just not mentally there. She writes under the assumption you know what she means.
"Rebenintcsh is a kind and caring woman. She's accessible, but sometimes easily distracted. Miss 3 classes and you get dropped a letter grade. Sometimes she skips attendance, but please, show up. Labs and prelabs aren't super difficult, but the long-term programs get more intense."
"Professor Rebenitsch has a kind and cheerful demeanor. She is willing to help if you have any questions. Sadly, she doesnt seem to believe in proofreading. Test questions, program assignments, and communications are usually filled with typos, grammar errors, and contradicting info. Grading, and the class is general, is handled in a sloppy manner."
"Hell yea Schrader, you da goat!"
"He was amazing! Very fun, teaches material thoroughly."
"The class is very dependent on his lectures which help with the weekly homework programs, he enjoys making fun of his students in a jokingly manner. The class is weighted heavily on tests which the averages ending up being around 73% each time. Has an average exam grade of 73% to pass the course requirement which he had to remove."
"He's a good teacher, just minor annoyances."
Schrader is god. Reincarnation of hamster
Schrader's coarse was my favorite course. He made programming a lot of fun. About the only thing I didn't like was the mandatory attendance. He was always available outside of class to help me with my homework.
This professor is a gem at the school. He teaches the two intro to CS courses and ensures you learn what he sets out to teach. The assignments are all very interesting and directly relate to the material you are being lectured about. He clearly cares about every one of his students and is available at any hour of the day. Can't recommend him enough
"Out of all of my professors, I have the most love-hate relationship with Roger. He's an amazing professor, but oh boy he knows how to get under your skin. If you don't like professors who pick on their students (all in good fun, nothing is actually hurtful) I wouldn't recommend him. He's amazing at responding to emails! Very helpful in person too"
"His assignments have multiple typos and unclear instructions, and he's the type of guy who makes fun of students instead of answering questions in a professional manner; would not recommend; sorry to all CSC majors because you'll have to go through him if you wanna continue on :("
"Schrader is the professor who loves to make fun of students, laugh at them for asking questions, and loves to give the most vague responses known to man. He'll also always INSIST he is correct on everything, even though most of his assignments have multiple typos and unclear instructions on what to do. Don't take him if you have the option."
"Schrader is a wonderful individual. He is available most hours of the day and even most Saturdays, so take time to see him as he can be vague or short in emails. His assignments are challenging, but applicable. However, they are pretty restricted. He also does not grant partial credit (don't forget your Doxygen). Lastly, informative lecture slides."
Roger is a great professor and anyone with the ability to take either of his classes should.
"Roger is freekin awesome! I wish he taught more courses, I would take them all. You will enjoy this professor for sure. He is very willing to work with you outside of class. He is even in his office on the weekends sometimes. He doesn't make you buy a pointless textbook and provides plenty of slides. One of the funnest professors I've ever had for."
"Schrader nearly always has his door open when he isn't teaching a class, which is really helpful for students who have busy schedules and can't always make it to specified office hours. He is clearly a busy man, but he puts his students' success above everything, so you will never feel like you are a burden if you go talk to him. The. Best."
"Has a very likeable personality. Takes a strong interest in you learning the material that he is teaching. His lectures are sometimes like drinking out of a fire hydrant, but he is very Is very accessible outside of class to answer any questions. He will gladly work with you to make sure you get what he is teaching. I enjoyed his class very much."
"Schrader is the kind of prof who would read these reviews to improve his class. Very approachable. I fell asleep half the days but he's great at poking fun instead of giving the condescending talk-down. Lots of work and he will fail you if you're not ready to move on, but that will save you pain down the road. 10/10 would recommend!"
"Schrader is great. Computer science can be hard, but there's only two exams and four programs. Programs for this class are more interesting and applicable. He is very clear on the algorithm for programs and how they should be done however, and has lots of office hours to help if anyone would like it. He has a fun time with the class which is fun!"
"good person, and a great programmer, but he's one of the worst instructors that I've had the displeasure to work with. His lectures are boring and his tests and programs are restrictive as heck. GO TO HIS OFFICE HOURS to get him to look at your programs, because his directions are full of problems and mistakes. No textbook, and his slides are wrong"
"obviously a great prof, kinda restrictive with projects, tests sometimes vague. if you don't like restrictions take someone else, otherwise take his class already."
pretty good csc teacher
Best CompSci professor at SDSMT
"Absolutely one of the worst professors at SDSMT. Extremely dry lecture, he gets his slides from online (not even his own) and just reads them off. He is very knowledgeable on the concepts but presents it in a very dry way. He will hold a review session to say exactly what will be on the exam, then put none of the things he said on it."
"It's one thing to be a dry lecturer. It's another thing to be a dry lecturer who makes his slides by copying and pasting directly from a dry textbook that he wrote. Dr. Pyeatt has high expectations for his students yet doesn't seem to have any standards for himself. Unfortunately, there never seems to be an alturnative teacher for his courses."
"I took the Introduction to Assembly Language from Dr. Pyeatt. In my opinion, the lectures, coursework and labs were poorly handled and confusing. The lectures and textbook do not adequately prepare students for the coursework, programs and labs, and Dr. Pyeatt is largely unreachable by email."
"The only thing holding this class together was the TA who is leaving this semester. His lectures were often behind, so the homework was due sometimes a week before we even reached that chapter. I often joked that he decided your test grade before he looked at your test because there seems to be no pattern to how he grades them."
"Pyeatt is one of those people who is a good guy but maybe not the best professor in the world. Lectures aren't the clearest, but he is plenty helpful outside of class. Tests were fair. HW was graded VERY loosely but tests and programs were graded quite harshly. Lots of work (labs and programs). Plenty of extra credit, so trying usually gets an A."
"He basically repeats everything his book already explains, without going into detail. You are learning a new language, but he never gives examples in class or explains anything. His labs are basically impossible to complete, and he is no help with them. Sadly, this class is a requirement and he is the only one who teaches its, so god speed."
"Gives solid hints for what will be on the exams. Easy to find during posted office hours, but only then."
"The book has a lot that is not covered in lecture. If you only do lecture, you get a C or D. If you read the book, you get A or B."
"He has a great sense of humor, which is about the only positive I have to say for him. He helps very little in class and is terrible when trying to get help during office hours. Luckily, I had a great TA but otherwise the programs he assigns are nearly impossible to due based off in-class lectures."
Theres only three tests in the whole class and the first test is over 5 chapters. He told us that he designs the test so that they cant be finished. That would be fine with an alright curve but his curve is only 5 points. The classes average score on test 1 was 50%. He then said if you failed test 1 you should drop the class. Worst teacher ive had.
"Gives you a program right before spring break and tells you that it is due the week after spring break Tells you not to study a specific topic for the upcoming test, said topic is worth the most points on the test Expects you to come to class, yet never bothers to learn your name or take attendance The lab is horrible. I feel bad for the TA"
"He doesn't do much to actually teach coding-- kind of pawns that job off on the TA. Has a great sense of humor and helps if you ask, but I wish the course was more oriented toward real life application and not memorizing the parts individually."
"He is fairly good at explaining, but he also misses some of the finer details that makes it easier to learn. It doesn't help that the class itself is teaching a new language, which takes times for any student to learn. Overall the tests are extremely easy although the labs are fairly difficult. The book he wrote for the class has a lot of typos."
"Brian knows what's up. He can be very precise when it comes to grading, but genuinely wants to see you succeed and is clear with what he expects. He has spent time in industry and doesn't fall into the academic traps a lot of professors do. Brian is one of the only professors I've had in five years that takes feedback to heart. Would take again."
love you Brian
"Solid professor straight out of industry who understands and communicates how things REALLY work. None of the academic B.S. He will throw you right into the deep end then help you figure out how to swim. Great lectures jam-packed with useful information, you don't have to attend but you really should!"
Professor Butterfield has got to be my favorite professor at the school. You're in for a treat if you get to take a class with him!
"Professor Butterfield is the best professor I've ever had. He was very clear about what needed to get done, and went WAY out of his way to make sure each student succeeded. I made an account on this website just to leave a review for him. If you have the opportunity to take him for any class, I VERY strongly encourage you to do so."
Provided informative lectures directly based on industry experience. Created and led students through a semester project that stretches skills and expands their technical capabilities.
"Dr. Loveland is a good professor who deserves more credit than he's given. While sometimes the content of his lectures was a bit confusing, I think that was more the other professor's fault than his own. He is consistently available outside of class and wants to ensure your success by helping you with anything you're confused about. Would recommend"
"Very unclear standards and even worse feedback. Tests and assignments are just Jupyter notebooks, and the feedback is oftentimes just a negative score (-5). He also didn't tell us about a textbook we needed until week 7 when we moved to a new subject. When he announced test 2, he just said ""understand every line of code we have written this year."""
"He is not the best professor by any means but he is not bad. He is willing to work with you if you do not understand something or need more time. I felt the tests were reasonable and the general course load is not too harsh much less than the standard coding course. Overall, Okay. Just not any extraordinary."
"I really enjoyed Karlsson. Granted it was only a survey course, but he is a kind-hearted Swede who has great stories and clearly cares about his students. He ended up cancelling our final and classes most days because he wanted us to sleep in (it was a 9 AM). I can not say how he is in his real classes, but he strikes me as a good guy."
"Dr. Karlsson is fun to listen to and an easy grader. It just so happened that I didn't really care about any of the subject matters I had to take with him, but he is a nice guy and I enjoy his lectures. Make sure you read the textbook as I probably learned more there and he follows it closely (which I liked)."
"I had Christer for Data Structures and Algorithms (CSC 315). He is a fantastic professor and I always enjoyed going to class (That is if you have a talkative class, it can be boring if everyone is silent). Anyways, if you have the opportunity to take his class, I would highly recommend it."
Cares about the course material and his students. Lectures are typically well-organized. Exams were fair and open book this semester (would have been difficult otherwise). Amount of work was reasonable. Lenient with grading if you show a good effort. Project writeups were a bit unclear at times. Sometimes gave no examples on how to work HW probs.
My favorite professor!
"He has a genuine care for his students, and he's a great guy. His classes are hard, particularly if it's something he's passionate about. Tests will destroy you. Read the book - it helps. His lectures and program write ups can be rather unclear at times. He's a generous grader, he wants to give you points. He will get you through COA/OS alive."
"Dr. Karlsson isn't the worst professor, but he is far from a good professor. His classes are extremely difficult, and he seems to be confused by his on material often. Several time he gave me the wrong answers to questions, or just refused to answer them altogether. Be sure to ace the homework and projects, because the tests will ruin you."
"Committed to students' understanding, but is very sloppy in lectures and lecture notes. Hard to follow and remain interested during class."
Great Professor! There is a bit of a disconnect between the homework and what is being taught in class. Makes class interesting and worth going everyday. As long as you know 3rd grade math you should be set :).
Dr. Hoover is awesome! He makes class interesting so you aren't falling asleep and he is always there if you need help with anything.
very helpful. its great having an ee prof from the math dept. i benefited a lot from his open door policy.
"Good instructor, but his love of Mac not likeable"
Hoover made me do burpies for being late!!!
Good respected teacher. Willing to work with you so you have the chance to show what you learned.
I learned a lot in his class. Glad I took it! Dr. McGough is extremely helpful if you're proactive enough to ask him questions and give the class your all.
"OMG He's amazing!! Very knowledgeable and incredibly willing to help outside of class. 10/10, would recommend"
"He is a good teacher when actually teaching, but after that, he is less than helpful with problem solving. This is the first semester this course is being offered so it is more understandable, but I am very disappointed with how he struggles to help students."
Good professor for parallel class. Stayed late (10 pm +) in office and fielded questions!
"Take if you want to hear about how he could be making more money doing something else. Overly emotional at times. Seems to think that grading is a huge burden and not what he gets paid to do or something. Test grading is often arbitrary and not usually based on correctness of answers, setting standards his own examples wouldn't fulfill."
"Dr. Deschamp is a fantastic professor. While he can come off as a hardass at times, he gives extremely clear and lectures and is more than willing to help outside of class. He used to be a structural engineer, so he gives lots of relevant examples in class that spice up some of the duller material."
"Hes a good lecturer and will help you learn the material, but hes horrible with tests. Hes a harsh grader and adds questions over stuff only discussed briefly. Both my semester and the semester before me had a 45% average on our first test, and 80% of the previous semester didnt pass the class. Avoid this Prof. if you want to actually pass"
I liked Brent until the end of the semester. He was very willing to help if you went into his office for help. Two people were caught cheating and it took it out on the whole entire class during the final. Treated us like we were in a detention center and made the final very hard. Disappointed in how much work I put into the class to do poorly.
"Deschamp is straight up about what he expects for homework and tests, and expects you to put in as much effort as he does. Hes always willing to help and makes sure everything is clear before moving on. 100% would take again"
"This guy thinks he's a tough grader, he's not. He just creates his own grading style which does not benefit the student. If you are about to take him just understand that this guy is the type of person who will annoy you most lectures."
"I wish he had better control over the class instead of entertaining every question from every student who thought they were funny. If you have a hard time learning verbatim definitions, do not take this class. If you have the time to make it to his office hours, great! I guarantee that you will learn more there than you ever will in his classroom."
"Great professor if you do what he says, and go to his office hours. Toughest grader I've encountered, but this has helped me perfect my homework and double check my exam solutions before turning it in."
"Harsh grader, but really clear in teaching and relating the material to real life. Awesome story-times. Highly recommend."
"Daily homework, not for credit, but if you don't do it -- good luck doing well on the tests. Tests are fair and cover the material from the textbook, but not always what is discussed in class. Lecture is just a quick overview of what you should've read in the chapter... most learning is expected to be done on your own from the book."
"Dr. Riley is very friendly and writes fair tests, but I struggled with the lengthy daily homework he assigned and his lecture style. He presents the basics in class and expects students to read to extend their understanding. Reasonable enough, but I struggled with extending the course content."
"If possible take classes with anyone else, sad to think he's the head of the math department and gets away with telling people to leave the school. He isn't a people person to say the least."
Dr. Riley has high expectations of his students but is very approachable outside of class. Ask for help when you need it and you will have no trouble passing!!!
"He is a great lecturer, but likes to ask trick questions on homework and tests. He frequently expects you to make illogical jumps between what he says and what he wants. Overall, I feel like I finished with a good grasp of the subject, but I have never had to work so hard for a B."
"Riley's classes are not easy. Overall, hes actually a very good teacher, and on a personal level a really nice guy. However, his tests are very hard, and you really have to know what your doing to get a good grade."
