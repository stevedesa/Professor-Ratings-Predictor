    "## Introduction\n",
    "Predicting a professor’s rating (1 to 5 stars) from student-written reviews is a challenging natural language processing task. In this project, I built a text classification system from scratch to classify reviews by their star rating. I use only NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib for implementation – no high-level ML libraries like scikit-learn, TensorFlow were used. My dev process included:  \n",

    "- **Data Exploration**: Understanding the dataset characteristics through rating distribution and word frequency analysis.  \n",
    "- **Text Preprocessing**: Cleaning and tokenize review text (lowercasing, removing punctuation and stopwords) to prepare for feature extraction.  \n",
    "- **Feature Engineering**: Implementing a bag-of-words model with Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) weighting from scratch.  \n",
    "- **Model Development**: Considering simple classifiers (Naive Bayes vs. Logistic Regression) and implementing a multi-class logistic regression model from scratch using gradient descent.\n",
    "- **Validation**: Performing 5-fold cross-validation on the training set to evaluate model performance (accuracy per fold) and ensure that the model generalizes.  \n",
    "- **Prediction**: Training the chosen model on the full training data and predict ratings for the test set, saving the results to `csc448_final_predictions.csv` in the required format (as provided in `rating_predictions_example.csv`).  \n",

    "## Model Selection Rationale\n",
    "\n",
    "For text classification, 2 simple models are Multinomial Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Naive Bayes (NB)** makes a simplifying assumption that words occur independently given the class. Despite this assumption, NB often works well for text and is easy to implement: we estimate word probabilities in each class from training data and use Bayes' rule to pick the most likely class for a new review.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Logistic Regression** (with a softmax for multi-class) learns direct decision boundaries in the feature space. It can potentially capture interactions between features better than NB and often achieves higher accuracy at the cost of a more complex training (requiring iterative optimization).\n",
    "\n",
    "**My Choice**: Implement a multi-class logistic regression from scratch. I chose logistic regression because:\n",
    "- It does not assume feature independence\n",
    "- Should handle the rich text features well\n",
    "- Allows weighting features optimally via gradient descent\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure theres no overfitting the high-dimensional TF-IDF features (remember, 5237 features for 518 samples), we will incorporate a regularization term (L2 penalty) in the training process.\n",
    "\n",
    "*(Note: Naive Bayes was also considered in this process (it can be implemented fairly easily with decent performance). However, logistic regression gave me better accuracy.)*\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementing Logistic Regression from Scratch\n",
    "\n",
    "We implement a 5-class logistic regression using gradient descent optimization. Key components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Weight Matrix W**: of shape (num_features + 1, num_classes). We include an extra bias term, so we will append a constant feature of 1 to each input example.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Softmax Function**: \n",
    "   - For an input vector x, and weights W, we compute scores for each class: `scores = x · W` (dot product)\n",
    "   - We convert these scores to probabilities with softmax: `p(class=j) = exp(score_j) / sum(exp(score_all))`\n",
    "   - This ensures a proper probability distribution over 5 classes\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Loss Function**:\n",
    "   - We use the cross-entropy loss for multi-class: `Loss = -Σ_y log(p(y))` (the negative log-likelihood of the true class)\n",
    "   - Gradient descent will minimize this loss\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Gradient Derivation**:\n",
    "   - The gradient of the loss w.r.t. weights can be derived from the softmax\n",
    "   - The result: `grad(W) = X^T * (pred_probs - true_onehot) / N` for the weight matrix (without regularization)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Regularization**:\n",
    "   - We add an L2 regularization term to the loss: `(λ/2)*||W||^2`\n",
    "   - The gradient of this w.r.t W is `λ * W`\n",
    "   - We will add `λ * W` to the gradient (for all weights except the bias term) to prevent overfitting by penalizing large weights\n",

    "In this project, I developed a text-based professor rating predictor from scratch. I:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Understood the data (noticing an imbalance and common words for different sentiments).\n",
    "2. Implemented a custom **TF-IDF vectorization**.\n",
    "3. Built a **logistic regression classifier** without using any ML lib.\n",
    "4. Validated my model with **5-fold cross-validation**, achieving ~66% accuracy (nearly double the baseline of predicting the most frequent class).\n",
    "5. Used my trained model to predict ratings for new reviews and saved the results in the required format.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Discussion**:  \n",
    "The model identifies many positive and negative reviews correctly by looking at the presence of tell-tale words (as seen in analysis). For example:\n",
    "- Mentions of \"unfair\", \"hard textbook\", or \"self-teach\" might push a prediction towards 1 or 2 stars\n",
    "- Words like \"amazing professor\", \"learned a lot\", or \"helpful\" might result in 5 stars\n",
    "\n",
    "However, some errors likely remain — especially for:\n",
    "- Ambiguous 3-star reviews\n",
    "- Cases where students use sarcasm or uncommon phrases (:/)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Potential Improvements** (given more time/data):\n",
    "- I wouldve loved to implement **bigrams** or possibly **trigrams** as features to capture context (distinguish \"not helpful\" from \"helpful\").\n",
    "- Try **alternative models** like simple neural networks (deep learning).\n",
    "\n",
    "Nonetheless, IMO, the current approach meets the requirements with a documented solution.\n",
